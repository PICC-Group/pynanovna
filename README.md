# pynanovna
This is a python module for using a NanoVNA.

## History
Originally this was the fork [nanovna-saver-headless](https://github.com/PICC-Group/nanovna-saver-headless) from [nanovna-saver](https://github.com/NanoVNA-Saver/nanovna-saver) but when that project no longer shared much code with the original we decided to create a new project.
